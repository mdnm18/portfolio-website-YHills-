<h1>3. My Personal Portfolio Website</h1>
Welcome to the official repository for my personal portfolio website. This project is a comprehensive showcase of my skills, experiences, and projects as a software engineering student. It's built from the ground up using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating a modern, creative design and a host of interactive features to provide an engaging user experience.
<br></br>


**🌟 Key Features**
This portfolio is more than just a static page; it's an interactive application designed to be both visually stunning and highly functional.

-> UI & UX Enhancements
 - Fully Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, from large desktop monitors to mobile devices.
 - Extraordinary Custom Cursor: An interactive cursor that changes its style when hovering over different elements (text, links, images), providing a unique and engaging browsing experience.
 - Light/Dark Theme Toggle: A sleek toggle button in the navbar allows users to switch between a light and dark theme, with the preference saved in their browser.
 - Animated Background: Subtle, pulsing background bubbles create a dynamic and modern feel without being distracting.

-> Interactive Sections
 - Glassmorphism Navbar: A modern, semi-transparent navbar with a blur effect that sticks to the top on scroll. It features a live clock that displays the current time and date.
 - 3D Interactive Skill Cards: The "Tech Stacks" section features cards that tilt in 3D space based on the user's mouse movement, creating a parallax effect.
 - Auto-Scrolling Portfolio Marquee: The portfolio section is an infinite horizontal scroller that showcases projects and pauses on hover for better viewing.
 - Timeline Experience Section: A clean, vertical timeline to visually represent my professional experience and contributions.
 - Modern Gallery: A responsive grid-based gallery to showcase images.

-> Functional Backend (Client-Side)
- Working Contact Form: A fully functional "Get In Touch" form that captures user messages.
- Response Storage: All form submissions are saved directly to the browser's localStorage in JSON format, complete with timestamps.
- Hidden Admin Panel: A secure, password-protected admin section where I can view all the contact form responses.
                      - Functionality: The admin panel dynamically retrieves and displays all messages from localStorage in a clean, readable format.

**🛠️ Tech Stack**
This project was built using core web technologies, demonstrating strong foundational skills without relying on external frameworks.

- HTML5: For the structure and semantic content of the website.
- CSS3: For all styling, including Flexbox, Grid, custom properties (variables) for theming, advanced animations, and responsive design.
- JavaScript (ES6+): For all interactivity, DOM manipulation, and client-side logic, including the theme switcher, live clock, custom cursor, and the localStorage admin panel functionality.

**🚀 How to Run This Project Locally**
No complex setup is required! Since this is a static website, you can run it directly in your browser.

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/mdnm18/your-portfolio-repo.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd your-portfolio-repo

3. Open the index.html file:

Simply double-click the index.html file in your file explorer.

Alternatively, you can use a live server extension in your code editor (like VS Code's "Live Server") for a better development experience with auto-reloading.

**🔐 Accessing the Admin Panel**
To view the contact form submissions:

1. Click on the "Admin" link in the navigation bar.
2. You will be prompted to enter a password.
3. Enter the password: ******

If the password is correct, you will be shown a list of all messages submitted through the contact form, sorted from newest first.
